Sure. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where the next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it. The sequence starts with 0 and 1. Here is a simple python function that calculates Fibonacci sequence:


def fibonacci(n):
    fib_sequence = [0, 1]
    while len(fib_sequence) < n:
        fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2])
    return fib_sequence

This function takes an integer 'n' as a parameter, which is the length of the Fibonacci sequence we want to generate. It starts with a list containing the first two numbers of the sequence, 0 and 1. Then it enters a loop where it continually appends the sum of the last two numbers in the list, until the list is the required length.

Please note that Python list indices are 0-based, so the "-1" and "-2" indices refer to the last and second last numbers in the list respectively.
